# Hi there 👋

## Get to know me -->

I am Arrum or people usually call me Ayum (both are okay!). A **Security Operation (SecOps) Specialist** based in Indonesia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia). I keep systems patched, stable, and secure — especially in highly regulated environments like *banking*.  
I like turning noisy, boring maintenance work into something reliable and almost invisible.
